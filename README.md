I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional with a profound interest in technology, data protection, and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey originally started in 1998 when I had the opportunity to assist the civilian IT team at Reynolds Army Community Hospital with upgrading desktops system-wide as Y2K loomed on the horizon. I was able to parlay that experience into a role as a 5E Switch Technician at Lucent Technoligies after my Army enlistment from 1999 - 2002. A downturn in the Telecom industry led me back into the Medical side, in both operations and Sales, for medical equipment/device providers.

For the last 10 years I have held client-facing roles in ITAD, or IT Asset Disposal, which has a strong focus on the data security and destruction for End-Of-Life IT assets (as defined by NIST 800-88). This has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity and coding, and I am now eager to transition into this field. I spend my free time creating hands-on experiences for myself, whether it is through vulnerability management, threat detection and mitigation using my home lab, praticing and developing my ethical hacking skills through CTF projects and bug bounties, or various coding projects (mainly with Python and SQL).
